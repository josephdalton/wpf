//This is a function with 3 parameters, (to complete the requirements in the rubric)
//Do I make enough money, with 3 paychecks, to buy a flat screen TV?

function paychecks (paycheck1, paycheck2, paycheck3){
     alert("paycheck1 = 200 " + ", paycheck2= 250," + " paycheck3= 189");
{
	 console.log("You do not have enough for the tv, keep saving!");
}

//There are significant issues with this code. It won't run, has significant issues with structure, missing braces, no conditionals (as stated in the comments).
